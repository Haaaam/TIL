      "\n",

      "Example:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Happy birthday to the most awesome Andrew in the world! May your day be as epic as your beard and your love for [insert hobby or interest here] üòÇ\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Heartfelt Words: If you want to express your feelings in a more heartfelt way, try writing a message that speaks to the importance of Andrew in your life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Andrew, you're more than just a friend to me. You're a constant source of support, laughter, and inspiration. I'm so grateful to have you in my life, and I can't wait to see what the next year brings for you. Happy birthday, my dear friend! ‚ù§Ô∏è\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Inside Joke: If you and Andrew share a special inside joke or reference, consider including it in your card. It will make the message more personal and meaningful to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Happy birthday to the only person I know who can make me laugh as hard as I did when we [insert inside joke here]! I hope your day is as amazing as you are, Andrew. üòÇ\"\n",
